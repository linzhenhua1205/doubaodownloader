### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: The skill may collect sensitive business context, financial assumptions, and generated strategy reports during research workflows. <br>
Mitigation: Use only approved business inputs, avoid credentials, regulated data, unreleased strategy, and proprietary financials unless authorized, and review retained artifacts after completion. <br>
Risk: The workflow saves reports, logs, raw data, and feedback in the workspace, which may be accessible beyond the immediate run. <br>
Mitigation: Run in an appropriate workspace, limit access to generated artifacts, and remove or protect saved reports and logs when they contain confidential information. <br>
